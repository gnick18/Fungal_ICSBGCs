Host:    e2006.chtc.wisc.edu (AVX512, FMA3, 503 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s EOG092C5Q82_aln_trimmed.fas -m TEST -bb 1000 -nt 1 -mem 30G -safe -T 1
Seed:    280571 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Mon Feb 21 01:04:20 2022
Kernel:  Safe AVX+FMA - 1 threads (40 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 40 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading alignment file EOG092C5Q82_aln_trimmed.fas ... Fasta format detected
Alignment most likely contains protein sequences
Alignment has 2900 sequences with 151 columns, 151 distinct patterns
142 parsimony-informative, 3 singleton sites, 6 constant sites
